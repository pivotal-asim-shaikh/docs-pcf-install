This topic lists the requirements for installing [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).


## <a id='general'></a> General Requirements

## <a id="aws"></a> AWS Requirements

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a high-availability (HA) [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment with Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on Amazon Web Services infrastructure:

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These requirements assume you are using an external database and external file storage.</p>

* 3 Elastic Load Balancers
* 1 Relational Database Service. As a minimum, Pivotal recommends using a db.m3.xlarge instance with at least 100&nbsp;GB of allocated storage.
* 5 S3 Buckets
* EC2 instances (VMs):
  - **PAS**: At a minimum, a new AWS deployment requires the following VMs for PAS:
<table border='1' class='nice'>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan=7>PAS and Ops Manager</th>
    <th>VM Type</th>
    <th>VM Count</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>t2.micro</td>
    <td>24</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>m4.large</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>r4.xlarge</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>r4.large</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>t2.small</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>t2.medium</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
By default, PAS deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require HA, you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).
  - **Small Footprint PAS**: To run Small Footprint PAS, a new AWS deployment requires:

  <tr>
  	<th>AWS Requirements</th>
    <th>VM Type</th>
    <th>VM Count</th>
    <th>Notes</th>

    <th rowspan=5>Small Footprint PAS</th>
    <td>m4.large</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>r4.large</td>
    <td>1</td>

    <td>r4.xlarge</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>t2.micro</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>Add 1 to count if using HAProxy</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>t2.small</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
  	<th rowspan=2>Ops Manager</th>
    <td>m4.large</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>c4.xlarge</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

In addition to the resources above, you must have the following to install PCF on AWS:

* An AWS account that can accommodate the minimum resource requirements for a PCF installation.
* The appropriate region selected within your AWS account. 
For help selecting the correct region for your deployment, see the [AWS documentation about regions and availability zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones).
* The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your machine and configured with user credentials that have admin access to your AWS account.
* Sufficiently high instance limits, or no instance limits, on your AWS account. Installing PCF requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances.
* A key pair to use with your PCF deployment. For more information, see the [AWS documentation about creating a key pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* A registered wildcard domain for your PCF installation. You need this registered domain when configuring your SSL certificate and Cloud Controller. 
For more information, see the [AWS documentation about Creating a Server Certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html#create-cert).
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed certificate, but Pivotal recommends using a self-signed certificate for testing and development. 
You should obtain a certificate from your Certificate Authority for use in production. 
For more information, see the [AWS documentation about SSL certificates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html).

### <a id="aws_certs"></a> Certificate Requirements on AWS

If you are deploying PCF on AWS, then the certificate that you configure in PAS must match the certificate that you upload to AWS as a prerequisite to PCF deployment. 

See [Certificate Requirements](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#certtypes) for general certificate requirements for deploying PCF.


## <a id="security"></a> AWS Security Documents

* [AWS Identity and Access Management guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)<br />
This guide is a reference for AWS' Identity and Access Management (IAM) features. If you are new to AWS, start here.<br />
<br />
* [AWS identity documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html)<br /> 
* [AWS credential documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html)<br />
This documentation provides a general definition of IAM terms and provide best practices to help you manage IaaS users and permissions. 


## <a id="permissions"></a> AWS Permissions Guidelines

Pivotal recommends following the principle of least privilege by scoping privileges to the most restrictive permissions possible for a given role. See [AWS Permissions Guidelines](./aws-iaas-user-roles.html) for recommendations on how to create and scope AWS accounts for PCF.


## <a id='delete-pcf'></a> Delete PCF on AWS

You can use the AWS console to remove an installation of all components, but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment:
